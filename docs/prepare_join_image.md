# Preparing the join docker images
The gist of this can be found in `test2.sh`, but here are the steps:

1. Build the genesis docker image, using the Makefile command build-genesis.
2. This will use DockerfileGenesis to build the image.
3. The image, when launched in a container, will run `init-docker-genesis.sh`, which will:
   4. Initialize the genesis node with the correct settings.
   5. Create and add a genesis account.
   6. Launch the chain
7. Now build the api docker image, using the Makefile `release-docker` in `decentralized-api`
8. Launch the api docker image, being sure that KEY_NAME is set to "genesis"
7. Now you can use files generated by the genesis node to create files in `./inference-chain/build`: 
   8. `genesis.json` - this is found on the docker container at `/root/.inference/config`
   9. `inferenced` - this is the executable built by the Makefile, it should already be in `./inference-chain/build`
   10. `config.env` - This has two important values:
       11. SEEDS - This is the address of the genesis node (at a minimum), in the format of {{node_id}}@{{node-ip-address}}:{{port}}
           12. The node_id is retrieved by running `inferenced tendermint show-node-id`
           13. The ip address needs to be a public URL or IP address.
           14. The port is usually 26656
       15. ADD_ENDPOINT - This is the address of the API for the genesis node, which you launched previously. Again, this will need to be available publicly on the internet.
